This code is meant to be run from the OHRbIT directory by executing the following in a bash terminal:
python -i cli_OHRbIT.py
The user can then execute commands built on the submodules that get imported from OHRbIT_SIMULATOR.


This project is structured s/t the user can execute complex functions from the command line with simple commands.
These higher level functions that have been tested are: GENERATE_GRIDS and interpolate_test

When running interpolate_test, ensure that GENERATE_GRIDS acts on the Test file in read_acceleration.
This is done either by commenting/uncommenting appropriate lines in core_tools.pathDefinitions, or on execution.
